            <p>
              India's third lunar exploration mission, Chandrayaan-3 is ready to
              take off in fourth operational mission (M4) of LVM3 launcher. ISRO
              is crossing new frontiers by demonstrating soft landing on lunar
              surface by its lunar module and demonstrate roving on the lunar
              terrain. It is expected to be supportive to ISRO's future
              interplanetary missions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally the deployment of rover and in-situ scientific
              experiment will scale new heights in lunar expeditions by
              deploying Rover.

            <p>
              Chandrayaan-3 is a follow-on mission to Chandrayaan-2 to
              demonstrate end-to-end capability in safe landing and roving on
              the lunar surface. It consists of Lander and Rover configuration.
              It was successfully launched by LVM3 from SDSC SHAR, Sriharikota
              on 14th July, 2023.

            <p>
              After a series of Earth bound manoeuvres that placed Chandrayaan-3
              in a trans-lunar injection orbit, ISRO performed a lunar-orbit
              insertion (LOI) on 5 August, successfully placing the
              Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft into an orbit around the Moon.

              August 05: Chandrayaan-3 mission achieved a crucial milestone
              with the successful completion of the Lunar Orbit Insertion (LOI).
              The insertion was carried out by retro-burning at the Perilune for
              1835 seconds, starting at 19:12 Hrs IST. The maneuver resulted in
              an orbit of 164 km x 18074 km, as intended.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is the third time in succession that ISRO has successfully
              inserted its spacecraft into the lunar orbit, apart from doing so
              into the Martian orbit.

                The Chandrayaan-3's Lander Module's final deboosting operation has reduced its orbit to 25x134 km around the Moon, Isro said on Sunday. The powered descent began on August 23, 5:45 pm, in four broad phases: Rough braking phase; Attitude Hold Phase; Fine Braking Phase; Terminal Descent Phase.

            <p>
                On September 4, the lander and rover was put into sleep mode during lunar sunset awaiting their awakening around September 22, 2023. Efforts to establish communication and awaken it are still underway.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chandrayaan-3 was instrumental in providing many valuable informations about moon like the content of its atmosphere and temperature change on moving down the surface.
